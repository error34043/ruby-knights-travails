# Knight's Travails

This is a program which accepts user input for starting and ending positions of a knight on a chess board and displays the lowest number of moves required for the knight to make the journey.

This project was created as part of the [TOP curriculum](https://theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lnav#project-2-knights-travails). The reference used for understanding the Breadth First Search algorithm implemented in this program is [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/gs.pdf).
